/*
We start from index 0 moving from left to right, trying to keep minimum values at each index

Assume requirement to be 'k', and length of string as 'n'
For index 'i', if we fill it with value 'x' (our goal is to find out 'x'),
    we have 'n-i-1' places remaining which can be filled upto a value of 26*(n-i-1)`    => Availability
    but the value required from those places is 'k-x'   => Requirement
    As availability>=requirement,
        k-x<=26*(n-i-1) => x>=k-26*(n-i-1)
        So, x=max(k-26*(n-i-1),1) [sanity check, as minimum value has to be 1]

class Solution {
public:
    string getSmallestString(int n, int k) {
        string res="";
        int reqd=k;
        
        for(auto i=0;i<n;i++){
            int suitable_value=max(reqd-26*(n-i-1),1);
            char ch=96+suitable_value;
            res+=ch;
            reqd-=suitable_value;
        }
